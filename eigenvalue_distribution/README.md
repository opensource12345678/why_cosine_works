# Released eigenvalue distributions

Each line has two numbers "eigenvalue" and "density", separated by a single
space, where "eigenvalue" represents the eigenvalue for that interval, "density"
represents the density of that interval.

All density may not exactly add up to 1 due to the estimation precision
problem. Please normalize them if necessary.
